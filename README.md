<b>HISTORY</b><br>
<blockquote>The origins of <u>match 3 games</u> are in the late 1980s with games such as <i>Tetris, Chain Shot! (SameGame) and Puzznic</i>. The de-facto first match 3 games were released for DOS in 1994 called <i>“Shariki”</i>. This gave rise to bubble shooters. Which also falls into the match 3 category. The legendary <i>Zuma</i> for PC can be referred to as a pioneering game. The idea of matching elements with gunshots was launched in 2003. And was quickly picked up by the game development community. This caused a real bubble shooter boom (<i>Luxor, Frozen Bubble, etc.</i>). Match 3 games were made popular throughout the 2000s. Specifically, in the form of casual games distributed or played over the Internet. Notably the Bejeweled series of games. They have remained popular since. With the game <i>Candy Crush Saga</i> becoming one of the most widely-played casual games worldwide.</blockquote>

<b>GOALS</b><br>
<blockquote>The <u>goal of match 3 games</u> is <u>to form lines, chains, or groups of three or more of the same elements</u>. Your task is to line up the tiles and achieve three-in-a-row. When this happens, it causes a chain reaction of more tiles to match, before the line or matches disappear. The core challenge of match 3 games is to identify patterns on a seemingly chaotic board. The number of adjoining tiles is often three, hence being called a “match 3” game. </blockquote>

<b>RULES</b><br>
<blockquote>The board has various tiles that you need to move around, shift, or rotate in order to get them to drop down and match into lines or groups. In addition to matching three in a row, games with storylines are more interesting. Games that are timed may provide added pressure and a level of skill—something that you may enjoy if you’re up for an added challenge.

The player must continuously remove the newly added tiles through matching. The game may end with a loss when the board is filled with tiles. Or, if there are no more possible matches. And it may end with a victory when the player clears the board or reaches a given score.</blockquote>
